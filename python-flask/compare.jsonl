{"prompt":"Xbox One vs PS4 ->","completion":" Xbox One vs PS4 is the ultimate showdown between the last-gen consoles. The Xbox One vs PS4 is somewhat moot now that we have the Xbox Series X and PS5. But the long tail of the past console generation with cross-generation games rather common, now might be a good time to pick up which ever console you don't have. Or you could be feeling nostalgic an want to know which console comes out of top all these years after their initial release. So take a look at our PS4 vs Xbox One breakdown to see which last-gen machine is the current winner. Xbox One vs PS4: Still worth getting? Given that tracking down PS5 restock or Xbox Series X restock is stupidly tough, at the time of writing, one of the easier ways to get a 'new' console is to op for one from the previous generation. Both the Xbox One and PS4 are still worthy consoles offering gaming at 1080p, though the Xbox One X can hit up to 4K. Furthermore, with a mature library of games, you won't be short on things to play as you wait for the new Microsoft and Sony consoles to become easier to buy. Xbox One vs PS4: Game library Given both consoles are now last-generation machines, there's not a huge gulf between the game libraries of the PS5 and Xbox One. Both have access to some of the best games ever like Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Witcher 3, as well as a suite of indie games. There are some core differences. The Xbox One gets access to a wider range of backward compatible games dating back to the original Xbox, as well as access to Xbox Game Pass, which provides a huge suite of games, old and new, to play for a monthly fee. But the PS4 has access to a range of simply kilter exclusive games from The Last of Us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima to Uncharted 4 and God of War. These games are very good and arguably give the PS4 the edge. That's not to say the Xbox One is devoid of great first party games — titles such as Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Halo 5, Ori and the Blind Forest and Sunset Overdrive are all major standouts. Winner: PS4. Both systems have a lot of great games, but Sony's system has more hit games that you can only play on a console. Xbox One vs PS4: Backwards compatibilityIf you have a library of existing Xbox 3060 and original Xbox game, then the Xbox One is the console to get for backwards compatalbity. It'll play nice with a lot of older games, including classics like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Ninja Gaiden Black and Jade Empire. Plus, with the Microsoft's Play Anywhere initiative, you can buy digital versions of games such as Sea of Thieves and Forza Motorsport 7 once and play them on Xbox One and on Windows 10. And as the extra cherry on top, Xbox One games that get optimized and upgraded for the Xbox Series X and Series S will be free to download on the newer hardware for people who already own them. You can play older games on PS4, but the need to be digital editions, as the console can't read older PS3 or PS2 discs. PlayStation Now lets you stream and download older PlayStation games on the PS4 for $9.99 a month or $59.99 for 12 months in the U.S., £49.99 for a year in the U.K. But overall, the PS4 lacks the depth and ease-of-use of backwards compatalbity on the Xbox One. Winner: Xbox One. Xbox One plays hundreds of Xbox 360 games, offers cross-play with PC and lets you binge on three generations' worth of games for a good price. Xbox One vs PS4: Hardware The PS4 Slim and Xbox One S are both impressively sleek, offering attractive designs that look great under a TV and can fit into a backpack without a problem. The newest PS4 has a slight edge in terms of sheer smallness, though it lacks an optical input for high-end gaming headsets. Sony's 4K-ready PS4 Pro has a chunkier, hamburger-like design, while the Xbox One X, which is even more powerful than the Pro, is somehow slimmer than the Xbox One S. Both consoles start with 500GB of storage that you can easily expand by connecting one of the best external hard drives for PS4 and Xbox One. PS4 owners also have the option of opening up their consoles to swap in a new 2.5-inch or SATA drive.Each controller has its perks — the Xbox One pad has textured grips and can be customized via the Xbox Design Lab, while Sony's DualShock 4 is highly ergonomic and has a touchpad and reactive lightbar. The PS4 controller is the only one that supports micro USB charging right out of the box — Xbox One owners will need to rely on AA batteries or buy a $25 charging kit. Thanks to the $299 PlayStation VR headset, PS4 is the only of the two consoles to currently support virtual reality. The PSVR's game lineup has grown quite compelling over the years, too, headlined by such major titles as Tetris Effect, Resident Evil 7, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Moss. There's currently no equivalent for Xbox One, and it doesn't look like Microsoft plans to bring VR to Xbox anytime soon. Microsoft's console is currently the only of the two to support mouse and keyboard controls for gaming, with select titles such as Fortnite and Warframe supporting PC peripherals such as the Razer Turret. Additionally, Microsoft has promised widespread compatibility for Xbox One accessories with the Xbox Series X. Just about any accessory you buy for the Xbox One will also function with the Xbox Series X later this year, meaning that your headsets, racing wheels, fightsticks and other immersion-building gadgets will continue to function on the next generation of consoles. Winner: PS4. Sony's console is more attractive, packs a more feature-rich controller and currently is the only of the two to support virtual reality. Xbox One vs PS4: Performance and graphics On paper both the PS4 and Xbox One have similar specs. They use a custom 8-core x86-64 AMD Jaguar processor that's backed up by 8GB or RAM, with graphics taken care of by an AMD Radeon GPU. Both consoles use 500GB transitional spinning disc drive. Yet despite these specs, the PS4 is actually better at putting down its power than the Xbox One. That's because Microsoft's games console uses some of its resources to power the operating system, meaning it has less grunt to bring to bear on games. As such, in some games the Xbox One kicks out a resolution of 900p, whereas the PS4 hits the Full HD 1080p resolution. So the PS4 has the edge when it comes to delivering the crispest of last-generation graphics. But this is flipped when comparing the Xbox One X against the PS4 Pro. Microsoft's console tends to target a native 4K output, whereas Sony's powered-up PS4 used chequerboard rendering to take lower resolution images and upscale them to 4K rather than hit native 4K. For a comprehensive breakdown of how these consoles compare, check out our article pitting the Xbox One X vs. PS4 Pro face-off. Winner: PS4. Games still look great on both consoles, but the base PS4 offers better resolution for many titles. Xbox One vs PS4: Interface While the Xbox One interface started out life as a bit of a sluggish mess it's not much improved. It runs well and is feature rich, with access to a myriad of tools and settings from as simple push of the Xbox button on the controller. Its tiled interface perhaps isn't as slick as other the UI on other game consoles, but it's information rich, flagging things like the latest Xbox Game Pass games. And thanks to Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can now stream games from the cloud to the Xbox One providing your internet connection is fast enough. There's also Amazon Alexa voice control should you wish to shout commands at your console. The PS4 menu takes a different path and arranges game and setting in a single line, with drop down option below. It's dead easy to use and there's are neat features like being able to tap the DualShock 4's Share button lets you record a clip, broadcast your gameplay or take a screenshot. There are plenty of option in the menu, but they are kept out of the way. Arguably the PS4 doesn't serve up as much information as the box One, but it certainly keeps things neater and cleaner. Plus the soothing background music is pleasant to the ear. Both consoles can broadcast gameplay directly to Twitch, though only PS4 can stream to YouTube. PS4 players can share their screenshots and videos to Facebook and Twitter, whereas Xbox owners are limited to the latter network. Xbox One gamers have the option of streaming to Microsoft's Mixer service. Both systems also permit off-TV play, for those times the family is hogging the living room. Sony's Remote Play feature lets you stream PS4 games to a PlayStation Vita handheld, select Xperia devices, or your PC and Mac. Xbox One players, on the other hand, can stream their games to their Windows 10 laptops or tablets. Winner: Draw. Both interfaces have their merits and minor drawbacks. providing you're willing to familiarize yourself with the UI, both are fit for purpose. But the PS5's interface is definitely the more attractive in our opinion. Xbox One vs PS4: Entertainment For sheer options, Xbox One is the superior entertainment machine. The system has the unique ability to transmit your cable box's TV signal, allowing you to quickly switch between playing a game and watching a show. The Xbox One S, Xbox One X and PS4 Pro can all stream 4K content, but only Microsoft's consoles can play 4K Blu-rays. However, the new Xbox One S All-Digital Edition has no disc drive at all, and is limited to 4K streaming. Unlike PS4, Xbox One supports Dolby Atmos, allowing folks with compatible home theater products to enjoy immersive spatial sound, and will soon support Dolby Vision for improved HDR quality. The Xbox One is also the only console that features Kodi, a highly popular media server app that lets you access any movies, TV shows, images or songs you have stored on any of your devices around the house. Other than that, both PS4 and Xbox One cover most entertainment essentials, from major apps like Netflix and Hulu to more niche stuff like WWE Network and Crunchyroll. PS4 and Xbox One both offer Spotify, which lets you rock out to tunes in the background of whatever you're playing. Xbox One features a few other notable music services such as SoundCloud, Pandora and Deezer. Winner: Xbox One. The Xbox One offers a 4K Blu-ray option, better media apps and Dolby Atmos support. Xbox Game Pass vs. PlayStation Plus Xbox Live Gold on the Xbox One will set you back $9.99 a month, but it grants you online multiplayer access as well as some free games to download each month and game discounts. But we suggest a subscription to Xbox Game Pass for the same monthly price. It provides access to more than 100 of the best Xbox One games and other games for older and newer consoles, as well as online multiplayer access. Opt to shell out for $14.99 and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives you access to Xbox and PC games, as well as cloud streaming and save syncing between all three platforms. Game Pass is basically a must have for Xbox fans and is one of the best bargains in gaming. Comparatively, PlayStation Plus members on the basic tier get two free games per PlayStation console for $10 a month, as well as game save cloud storage; Xbox One gets this for free. Discounts on on some of the best PS4 games can be had with PlayStation Plus memberships. Winner: Xbox Game Pass. Xbox Game Pass is such a bargain that it's hard for Sony to compete against it. And with new games set to launch day one on Game Pass, it's now an essential service for Xbox players. Xbox One vs PS4: Value The Xbox One S starts at $299 (£300\/AU$399), putting it on par with the $299 (£300\/AU$399) PS4 Slim. However, it's worth noting that both consoles go on sale all the time, and you can often find them both for as low as $200 (£200\/AU$320). The One S doubles as a 4K Blu-ray player, so you're arguably getting the most tech for your money with that machine. If you're on an extra-tight budget, you can opt for the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition ($249), which has no disc drive and includes Forza Horizon 3, Minecraft and Sea of Thieves. However, the standard Xbox One S drops to that price frequently, so you're probably better off waiting for a sale and getting the 4K Blu-ray drive for cheap -- especially if you don't want to rely entirely on digital downloads. Microsoft has recently brought back the Xbox All Access program. This lets you lease an Xbox One S, Xbox One X or Xbox One S All-Digital Edition starting at $19.99 a month for 24 month. According to Microsoft, this program saves you more than $100 compared to purchasing the console and bundled games separately. All Access members can upgrade to the upcoming Xbox Series X console starting late 2020, though there's no word yet on how much the upgrade will cost. If you want 4K gaming, Sony's PS4 Pro costs $399 (£399\/AU$600), while the Xbox One X runs a hefty $499 (£499\/AU$649). That's a pretty big price gap, though Microsoft's console offers a richer 4K gaming experience. (You can follow our PS4 deals and Xbox One deals coverage for the latest sales). Winner: Xbox One. The $249 (£300\/AU$399) Xbox One S is the cheapest console out there and doubles as a 4K Blu-ray player. Xbox One vs PS4: Bottom line It may seem odd to come to a conclusion on the best last-generation console, but as these machines are still getting games made for them, they are far from irrelevant. Ultimately, the PS4 is the overall winner, all down to its larger selection of exclusive games. However, you can't go wrong with an Xbox One S, especially when combined with the the frankly absurd bargain that Xbox Game Pass offers. In basic terms, if you don't have an PS4 and have an Xbox One, then it's still worth snapping up Sony's last-gen console, especially if you can find it at a bargain price, And the same applies in reverse. There is a overall winner here, but it's basically you, the console gamer."}
{"prompt":"iPhone vs. Android ->","completion":" iPhone vs. Android is the smartphone debate for the ages. The iPhone vs. Android comparison is a never-ending debate on which one is best. It will likely never have a real winner, but we're going to try and help you to find your personal pick all the same. The latest version of both operating systems — iOS 16 and Android 13 — are both excellent, but in slightly different ways. Many of their features overlap, but design-wise they look quite different, aside from the basic touchscreen-focused layout. Whichever of the best phones available today you buy, they'll be running one of these two OSes. Pitting iPhone vs. Android, we take a look at the respective strengths of each mobile platform, so you can pick the right one for you the next time you buy a smartphone. If you want to see the current flagships for Android and iOS, be sure to check out our Pixel 7 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max and Pixel 7 vs. iPhone 14 face-offs. And if you're convinced you want to leave your iPhone, read more about Google's new Switch To Android app that will help you move over.You're invested in Apple's ecosystem. iPhone vs Android: Why iPhone is better You're invested in Apple's ecosystem. This might seem like a shallow reason, but Apple obviously makes a wide breadth of tech products, and if you already own a Mac, iPad or Apple Watch, getting an iPhone makes a lot of sense. Apple has designed a multitude of continuity features that allow you to carry over work and data from one of its devices to another, and these features can certainly save you time. Take Handoff, for example, where calls on your iPhone and web pages in Safari can move seamlessly between iOS and macOS. Universal Clipboard makes text copied on one platform usable on the other. Another one of our favorites is Continuity Camera, which allows you to take pictures and scan documents using your iPhone's camera, and then view and edit them on your Mac. You can even complete purchases on your Mac by using biometric authentication features on your iPhone via Apple Pay. Only a handful of Android phone makers have hardware ecosystems that approach Apple's, and even for some that come close, like Samsung, you won't get the depth of integration possible between the iPhone and other Apple-built devices. Microsoft is helping Google close the gap somewhat with its new Your Phone app for Windows, which allows Android users to respond to texts and notifications on their PCs, though the experience is a little clunky and there is still work to be done. There are many other great examples of continuity across iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS — and the iPhone is a critical component in that puzzle, especially now that iPhone apps can be seamlessly ported to macOS. Power users already immersed in Apple's ecosystem can stand to gain a lot by adding an iPhone to their repertoire. And that's to say nothing of friends and family members who prefer to use iMessage and FaceTime to keep in touch. The third-party apps are just better. This one is definitely down to personal preference, but as someone who has jumped back and forth between iOS and Android, I've been consistently blown away by the quality of apps built by iOS developers, and mostly disappointed in their Android counterparts. Don't get me wrong — there's great software and developers on Android, but they're harder to find, in my experience. One of our favorite Twitter apps, Tweetbot 5, is an iOS exclusive, for example; by contrast, one of the best third-party Twitter apps we've encountered on Android, Fenix 2, strongly pales in comparison. One of our staff members, Henry T. Casey, loves using Bear to compose blog posts on his Mac and iPhone, but we've struggled to find a note-taking app on Android as comprehensive and slick.You may even find that apps from established companies, ranging from banks to airlines, are a bit smoother and cleaner on iOS than Android, with better integration with the phone's core services, like Wallet. There's a bigger selection of accessories. Walk into any Best Buy or Target, and you'll find aisles of cases for every iPhone that Apple makes — something that certainly cannot be said for the Android contingent outside of flagship devices from the biggest companies. Once you get past the semi-healthy selection of products made for the latest Galaxy S device, you're out of luck. Don't bother expecting a choice of accessories for your new Pixel or Motorola handset at any brick-and-mortar retailer. Sure, you could go online and snag a $4 case off of Amazon, but then you're guaranteed to get what you pay for. The selection and availability of iPhone cases, screen protectors, car mounts and other goodies is simply far greater than you'll find for any other phone, and that's more important than most people realize. iPhone owners will never have the problem of not finding a case to their liking. There are enhanced privacy controls with app tracking notifications. One of the biggest recent iOS releases introduced app tracking notifications, allowing you to opt out of apps tracking you across your phone. This was a major win for privacy advocates and a huge blow to many third-party companies, like Facebook. Android simply doesn't have this feature and we doubt it ever will. Don't get stuck in the belief that iOS is inherently more private than Android, since Apple still collects a ton of data about you, but iOS still has a bit more resilience when it comes to third-parties. It's so satisfying to deny an app the ability to track you. There's no bloatware. No matter how you buy your iPhone, where you buy it from or what iPhone you buy, you won't see any bloatware preinstalled when you boot it up for the first time. That means it's clean from the very start, with no power- or data-siphoning apps you didn't ask for sabotaging things behind the scenes.That's a relief if you've ever seen the way a new Android phone arrives out of the box — particularly one that you've bought through a carrier. Even spending $1,800 on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 doesn't spare AT&T customers from the affront of seeing software like CNN and DirecTV Now cluttering their app drawers. And it can be even worse if you buy a budget handset that has been heavily subsidized by a discount carrier. Android buyers who purchase one of the best unlocked phones without a service agreement will have better luck avoiding bloatware. It also depends on the company. For example, unlocked Pixel phones aren't mired down by any third-party apps; on the other hand, it's not totally unheard of for some unlocked handsets to come with the odd unwelcome sponsored software (or ads). You get quicker software updates. Android phones get fewer updates than iPhones, and when they do, they happen less frequently and are often delayed with the exception of Google's Pixels. The number of updates an Android phone sees over the course of its lifetime depends largely on how expensive it is, what carrier you buy it from (or if it's even purchased from a carrier at all) and what the phone maker's software support policy is. That's a far cry from iPhones, which are supported with major software updates for many years, no matter what. Take the iPhone 6S, for example, which received iOS 15, even though it originally launched with iOS 9 back in 2015. For comparison, consider Samsung's Galaxy S6, which launched the same year and started with Android 5.0 Lollipop. Not only does it lack the latest Android software, but it stopped getting updates years ago. It only made it as far as 7.0 Nougat when Samsung pulled the plug on support — and when the S6 did get Nougat, it arrived in March 2017, eight months after Google unveiled the update. What's more, when a new iOS version is released, it is available to everyone on the same day, at the same time, and can be installed on all models that support it instantaneously. By contrast, Android releases are rolled out in waves to individual phones, not just by model. It has better retail support. Let's say something goes horribly wrong with your iPhone, and you need to get it serviced. Or perhaps you want a screen protector installed on it, and you'd rather have it handled by a professional, who will slap that film on with nary a bubble or speck of dust. Whatever your issue is, it's nice to have a place to go — and what better place for iPhone users than the Apple Store. Yes, Covid restrictions can make this difficult, but at least you have the option. Owners of Android phones don't necessarily enjoy that luxury. If you need a new battery or a screen replacement and you didn't purchase a protection plan from the retailer you bought it from, you'll probably have to ship it back to the manufacturer. That's quite a time-consuming hassle, given how much we all depend on our phones day in and day out. Some reputable repair shops like uBreakiFix help bridge the gap a bit, like for Pixel phones. iPhone vs Android: Why Android is better There are phones at every price. The vast majority of the world's smartphones run Android, and because so many companies build Android handsets, they're available at every price range. There are cheap phones under the $500 mark like the Pixel 5a, as well as some of the best small phones and best big phones, and phablets and foldables far exceeding $1,000. No matter how much you can spend, chances are you can find an Android device that fits your budget or offers exclusive features. The same cannot be said for iPhones, which historically have been expensive at launch, only to come down in price after successive generations. One of the most affordable new Apple handsets is the iPhone 13 mini for $699, but that comes with a small 5.4-inch display. The Galaxy S21 FE has the same price but comes with a bigger and smoother 120Hz 6.4-inch screen, a telephoto lens and a much larger battery. And then there's the fantastic $599 Pixel 6, if you can find one in stock. The least-expensive iPhone that Apple offers is the iPhone SE (2022), which is a fantastic device with phenomenal performance for just $429, though its design is dated, and its screen will be too small for some. It's more customizable. Though both iOS and Android have evolved over the years, Android has always had a reputation for being the platform for users who like to tinker and personalize their devices. That starts with the home screen launcher, which offers dynamic widgets and the ability to place apps anywhere on a page or in a drawer, out of sight — something the iPhone has only recently caught up to with iOS 14. You can even swap out your Android phone's launcher with an alternative downloaded from the Google Play store. Android also lets you download third-party replacements for core services — like web browsers, keyboards and media players — and set them as the default versions if you prefer a third-party app to one that was preinstalled on your phone. iOS has improved in this regard over the years, though the implementation is still somewhat clunky. Finally, we have to talk about manufacturer skins — bespoke user interfaces and Android system software that are customized by certain phone makers, offering extra features and, often, the ability to create themes for your experience from top to bottom. Some Android fans prefer Google's interpretation of Android. However, but lots of users like phone makers' custom software, like Samsung's One UI or OnePlus' OxygenOS, because of their extra capabilities, such as the ability to take scrolling screenshots and hide photos and videos in password-protected folders. But Google changed things up with Android 12, which brings with it the new Material You design language. This direction builds upon the last several years of Android's look and feel, offering more personalization. There's a pseudo-theming system which adapts to the colors in your wallpapers and applies that shade system-wide. How the likes of Samsung and OnePlus tweak things in their own skins remains to be seen. You can (sometimes) expand the storage. Although expandable storage is somewhat less popular these days, some Android phones still offer it. This allows you to use a microSD card to keep photos, apps and other media that won't fit on your device's internal memory. That's an amazing benefit, given the exorbitant prices that Apple and other phone makers charge to double or quadruple storage when you buy your handset. Why tack on another $100 to $150 to the price of a new phone just for an extra 128GB or 256GB of storage (that you're not even sure you'll need) when you can just drop $70 on a 512GB card later? Additionally, while it's certainly becoming more of a rarity on high-end phones these days, some Android devices still come with headphone jacks — a hotly requested feature Apple retired from its phones in 2016. That's a big deal to people who still love to use their trusty old wired headphones. USB-C is universal. Android phones largely rely on USB-C ports for charging and data transfer these days, which is super convenient if you're one of those people who really likes to pack light and carry only one cable. USB-C is also on many PCs these days, as well as on the Nintendo Switch. It's a beautiful thing. Whereas Apple's Lightning cable is a relic of the days when every tech company felt compelled to develop its own proprietary connector, USB-C represents the ideal single-port solution the industry is working toward. It also opens doors to faster charging technologies. The OnePlus 9 Pro, for example, can charge from zero to 61 percent battery capacity in a mere 15 minutes. Wait for 30 minutes and you'll have a battery that’s 99 percent full. Compare that to the iPhone 12, which continues to stick with Lightning. And Apple no longer even includes a charger in the box. There's an actual file system (with drag-and-drop support on PC). Most people don't need to get their hands dirty with their smartphone's file system. Still, it's good to know that Android gives you that option, if you desire it. Even better, when you plug an Android handset into a Windows PC, you can very easily drag and drop files into folders, as if the device were just another drive. That means your media libraries and documents are a snap to carry over and store locally, and you don't have to subscribe to a monthly cloud service if you have an especially large library. iPhones obscure the file system from the user for everything except photos, which can be very frustrating for dealing with music, documents and other forms of media. Some Android phones, like the Galaxy S22 Ultra, even have special PC or display projection features, that let you use view and use your device in a desktop capacity. Samsung's DeX interface is one such example of this. With such versatility, a high-end Android phone could legitimately function as a replacement for one of the best Chromebooks or similarly ultraportable laptops. Innovative features usually land on Android phones first. Sure, Apple's coffers are pretty stacked. However, it is just one company, with one philosophy. As a result, iOS can be slow — or at least slower than the Android community — to adapt to emerging technologies. With so many companies building Android phones, it's little surprise that Android partners tend to beat Apple to the market with innovations in the mobile space. Wireless charging, fast charging, NFC, 4G LTE, 5G, OLED displays, in-screen fingerprint sensors, water resistance and multi-lens cameras all landed on Android devices before iPhones, as well as software breakthroughs like true multitasking, copy and paste and multiwindow support. Of course, this isn't to say Apple hasn't delivered breakthroughs of its own. The iPhone X wasn't the first phone with face recognition, but it was the first with one that worked reliably and securely. However, far more Android phones are released from a variety of vendors every year, so it's just a matter of scale that hardware running Google's platform is swifter to adapt. Which should you choose? So then, iPhone or Android: Which should you choose? Both platforms have pros and cons, and, as with many purchase decisions, your choice will depend on what you value most. Owning an iPhone is a simpler, more convenient experience. There's less to think about, and because Apple's iPhone represents the single most popular brand of smartphone, there's an abundance of support everywhere you go — whether you need your battery replaced or you're just trying to pick up a new case. Android-device ownership is a bit harder in those respects. Yet it's simultaneously more freeing, because it offers more choice — choice of how much you want to spend, choice of hardware and software features, and choice in how you organize and personalize your experience. If you're extremely particular about the technology you use, you might find Android more liberating — dare I say, fun — though you'll also likely lament the relative lack of high-quality apps (e.g. Twitter) and accessories. If you're wondering which particular device you should switch to, there's no better place to start than our lists of the best iPhones and best Android phones. Whichever device you pick, just make sure it fits with your operating system preferences."}
{"prompt":"Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 ->","completion":" This Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 preview has us intrigued We're excited about the Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 showdown that'll come once Samsung launches its latest flagship series. Until then, we've heard enough rumors and leaks to get a general idea of what to expect from this face-off. Samsung and Google are both gunning to have the best Android phone and to earn your hard-earned cash, though the latter might have the upper hand in terms of pricing if Samsung stays true to its pattern from the last couple of years. The Galaxy S23 will kick off Android flagships for 2023, while the Pixel 7 will be one of the de facto Android handsets to consider until its successor arrives late in the year. Here's what to expect from the Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 face-off. If true, the Pixel 7 would undercut Samsung's latest since it clocks in at a mere $599. For that price, you get the versatile Tensor G2 processor, a powerful dual camera system, and a 90Hz 1080p display. It's one the best deals in smartphones. The Galaxy S23, at least based on some leaked renders, appears to have a slight design change in the works. From what we've seen so far, Samsung looks to intend to bring the whole Galaxy S23 lineup together in terms of design language. That means the Galaxy S22's Contour Cut is allegedly out, replaced by individual camera lenses like what you find on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. We're OK with this direction if it proves to be true. Meanwhile, the Pixel 7 refined the design direction that Google introduced with the Pixel 6 in 2021. The distinctive camera bar remains, spanning the width of the phone. It's metal this time around, adding a pop of sophistication. We're sad to see the Pixel 6's three tone design go, which we thought added some personality to the Pixel lineup. Still, we love the Pixel 7's overall look. There's no other smartphone like it. As for displays, we expect the Galaxy S23 to remain at 6.1 inches with a FHD+ resolution. The Galaxy S22 could ramp up its refresh rate to 120Hz, but clock down to just 48MHz. Other competing phones go down to 10Hz, or even 1Hz (like the OnePlus 10 Pro or Galaxy S22 Ultra). The Galaxy S22 had a super bright display, measuring 1,152 nits in our testing. You should anticipate the Galaxy S23 to at least match that, if not exceed it. The Pixel 7 sports a great 6.3-inch OLED display with a FHD+ resolution and 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. While lacking the punchy colors and insane brightness of the Galaxy S22, it is more than visible in daylight with a max brightness of 926 nits in our testing. We won't be surprised if the Galaxy S23's display mops the floor with the Pixel 7, but that's because Samsung has the best panels in the Android market. The true victor in this showdown will earn its victory in the camera department. Google holds the title for the best Android camera phones. Despite Samsung making some major progress in recent years, the Galaxy S22 still struggles to keep up with the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. The Galaxy S23 Ultra might overtake Google, though. Samsung will likely keep the triple camera setup that's it had for a while now. The rumors say we'll see a 12MP main sensor along with a 12MP ultrawide shooter and a 10MP telephoto lens (another rumor says 11MP). As for zoom, the Galaxy S22 had a 3x optical capacity, so it's likely the Galaxy S23 will keep that. The latest rumors also say the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 will get a new 12MP front-facing camera, which would be an upgrade over the previous 10MP sensors. The Pixel 7 uses its 50MP main and 12MP ultrawide sensors to incredible effect. This phone takes amazing pictures in most scenarios, giving the iPhone 14 a major run for its money. Google reserved the telephoto lens for the Pixel 7 Pro, but the Pixel 7 enjoys all of the other computational photography tricks of its bigger brother. Those things include features like Magic Eraser, which can intelligently remove objects and people from your pictures; Photo Unblur which can repair a lot of blurry photos; and Active Stabilization, which acts as video stabilization on steroids. The Pixel 7 has set a high bar for the Galaxy S23 to clear. We're excited to see if Samsung can do it. When it comes to performance, we expect the Galaxy S23 to come equipped with more horsepower than the Pixel 7. That's because the Pixel's Tensor G2 chipset falls behind the Galaxy S22 and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in synthetic benchmarks. With the Galaxy S23 all but guaranteed to get the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Google is likely to fall further behind in performance. For instance, in Geekbench 5, the Pixel 7 turned in 1,054 \/ 3,021 in single-core and multicore, respectively. The Galaxy S22 scored 1,204 and 3,248. Not a huge gap, but it's likely to widen with the new Qualcomm chip. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story, since the Pixel 7's smarts far exceed what the Galaxy S22 can do. It's possible that Samsung will catch up with the Galaxy S23, but we're skeptical. The Pixel 7 did not wow us with its battery life. In our custom test, where we task a phone to endlessly reload web pages over a cellular connection, it returned a result of 7 hours and 17 minutes in its adaptive refresh rate mode. Not that the Galaxy S22 was much better at 7 hours and 51 minutes. We like to see at least ten hours in this test, so Samsung has a lot of room for improvement with the Galaxy S23. Rumors suggest the battery might get a boost to 3,885 mAh for the regular Galaxy S23 and 4,700 mAh for the Galaxy S23 Plus. If true, that ought to improve longevity. Another large differentiator between the Galaxy S23 and Pixel 7 will be software. Samsung's One UI is a feature-packed rendition of Android and the phone maker has vastly improved its software design and update schedule in recent years. One UI 5, based on Android 13, is solid, which is what the Galaxy S23 will run out of the box. The Pixel 7 runs Google's vision of Android 13, complete with the Material You theming engine. It's relatively stripped back compared to One UI, but don't let that fool you. Google has packed in a lot of useful things like the whole Call Suite (including the ever-useful Call Screen, which screens your calls), the photography stuff we mentioned earlier, and the Now Playing music identifier. The Pixel 7 also enjoys day one access to the latest updates and security patches from Google. There are also the quarterly Feature Drops, where Google introduces smaller feature sets outside of the annual Android release schedule. We won't say one is better than the other since it's a personal preference, but where Samsung currently leads Google comes down to how many updates it promises. It has committed to four years of platform updates and five years of security patches, which is the best you can get on an Android phone. That means the Galaxy S23 will receive Android 17 and security patches into 2028. Google, meanwhile, also promises five years of security updates, but only three years of Android upgrades. So Samsung has the advantage right out of the gate. The Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 face-off will be an interesting one. We should only have a couple more months to wait to see what Samsung has built, then we can pit the Galaxy S23 against Google's $599 flagship.The victory will ultimately depend on how each phone does in our camera and battery life tests. Google has quite a lead heading into this showdown, but Samsung could have a few tricks up its sleeve. For now, we will have to rely on rumors and leaks to get a better idea about the Galaxy S23, so be sure to check our Galaxy S23 hub for all of the latest news.
