{"prompt":"Xbox One vs PS4 ->","completion":" Xbox One vs PS4 is the ultimate showdown between the last-gen consoles. The Xbox One vs PS4 is somewhat moot now that we have the Xbox Series X and PS5. But the long tail of the past console generation with cross-generation games rather common, now might be a good time to pick up which ever console you don't have. Or you could be feeling nostalgic an want to know which console comes out of top all these years after their initial release. So take a look at our PS4 vs Xbox One breakdown to see which last-gen machine is the current winner. Xbox One vs PS4: Still worth getting? Given that tracking down PS5 restock or Xbox Series X restock is stupidly tough, at the time of writing, one of the easier ways to get a 'new' console is to op for one from the previous generation. Both the Xbox One and PS4 are still worthy consoles offering gaming at 1080p, though the Xbox One X can hit up to 4K. Furthermore, with a mature library of games, you won't be short on things to play as you wait for the new Microsoft and Sony consoles to become easier to buy. Xbox One vs PS4: Game library Given both consoles are now last-generation machines, there's not a huge gulf between the game libraries of the PS5 and Xbox One. Both have access to some of the best games ever like Red Dead Redemption 2 and The Witcher 3, as well as a suite of indie games. There are some core differences. The Xbox One gets access to a wider range of backward compatible games dating back to the original Xbox, as well as access to Xbox Game Pass, which provides a huge suite of games, old and new, to play for a monthly fee. But the PS4 has access to a range of simply kilter exclusive games from The Last of Us 2 and Ghost of Tsushima to Uncharted 4 and God of War. These games are very good and arguably give the PS4 the edge. That's not to say the Xbox One is devoid of great first party games — titles such as Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Halo 5, Ori and the Blind Forest and Sunset Overdrive are all major standouts. Winner: PS4. Both systems have a lot of great games, but Sony's system has more hit games that you can only play on a console. Xbox One vs PS4: Backwards compatibilityIf you have a library of existing Xbox 3060 and original Xbox game, then the Xbox One is the console to get for backwards compatalbity. It'll play nice with a lot of older games, including classics like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Ninja Gaiden Black and Jade Empire. Plus, with the Microsoft's Play Anywhere initiative, you can buy digital versions of games such as Sea of Thieves and Forza Motorsport 7 once and play them on Xbox One and on Windows 10. And as the extra cherry on top, Xbox One games that get optimized and upgraded for the Xbox Series X and Series S will be free to download on the newer hardware for people who already own them. You can play older games on PS4, but the need to be digital editions, as the console can't read older PS3 or PS2 discs. PlayStation Now lets you stream and download older PlayStation games on the PS4 for $9.99 a month or $59.99 for 12 months in the U.S., £49.99 for a year in the U.K. But overall, the PS4 lacks the depth and ease-of-use of backwards compatalbity on the Xbox One. Winner: Xbox One. Xbox One plays hundreds of Xbox 360 games, offers cross-play with PC and lets you binge on three generations' worth of games for a good price. Xbox One vs PS4: Hardware The PS4 Slim and Xbox One S are both impressively sleek, offering attractive designs that look great under a TV and can fit into a backpack without a problem. The newest PS4 has a slight edge in terms of sheer smallness, though it lacks an optical input for high-end gaming headsets. Sony's 4K-ready PS4 Pro has a chunkier, hamburger-like design, while the Xbox One X, which is even more powerful than the Pro, is somehow slimmer than the Xbox One S. Both consoles start with 500GB of storage that you can easily expand by connecting one of the best external hard drives for PS4 and Xbox One. PS4 owners also have the option of opening up their consoles to swap in a new 2.5-inch or SATA drive.Each controller has its perks — the Xbox One pad has textured grips and can be customized via the Xbox Design Lab, while Sony's DualShock 4 is highly ergonomic and has a touchpad and reactive lightbar. The PS4 controller is the only one that supports micro USB charging right out of the box — Xbox One owners will need to rely on AA batteries or buy a $25 charging kit. Thanks to the $299 PlayStation VR headset, PS4 is the only of the two consoles to currently support virtual reality. The PSVR's game lineup has grown quite compelling over the years, too, headlined by such major titles as Tetris Effect, Resident Evil 7, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Moss. There's currently no equivalent for Xbox One, and it doesn't look like Microsoft plans to bring VR to Xbox anytime soon. Microsoft's console is currently the only of the two to support mouse and keyboard controls for gaming, with select titles such as Fortnite and Warframe supporting PC peripherals such as the Razer Turret. Additionally, Microsoft has promised widespread compatibility for Xbox One accessories with the Xbox Series X. Just about any accessory you buy for the Xbox One will also function with the Xbox Series X later this year, meaning that your headsets, racing wheels, fightsticks and other immersion-building gadgets will continue to function on the next generation of consoles. Winner: PS4. Sony's console is more attractive, packs a more feature-rich controller and currently is the only of the two to support virtual reality. Xbox One vs PS4: Performance and graphics On paper both the PS4 and Xbox One have similar specs. They use a custom 8-core x86-64 AMD Jaguar processor that's backed up by 8GB or RAM, with graphics taken care of by an AMD Radeon GPU. Both consoles use 500GB transitional spinning disc drive. Yet despite these specs, the PS4 is actually better at putting down its power than the Xbox One. That's because Microsoft's games console uses some of its resources to power the operating system, meaning it has less grunt to bring to bear on games. As such, in some games the Xbox One kicks out a resolution of 900p, whereas the PS4 hits the Full HD 1080p resolution. So the PS4 has the edge when it comes to delivering the crispest of last-generation graphics. But this is flipped when comparing the Xbox One X against the PS4 Pro. Microsoft's console tends to target a native 4K output, whereas Sony's powered-up PS4 used chequerboard rendering to take lower resolution images and upscale them to 4K rather than hit native 4K. For a comprehensive breakdown of how these consoles compare, check out our article pitting the Xbox One X vs. PS4 Pro face-off. Winner: PS4. Games still look great on both consoles, but the base PS4 offers better resolution for many titles. Xbox One vs PS4: Interface While the Xbox One interface started out life as a bit of a sluggish mess it's not much improved. It runs well and is feature rich, with access to a myriad of tools and settings from as simple push of the Xbox button on the controller. Its tiled interface perhaps isn't as slick as other the UI on other game consoles, but it's information rich, flagging things like the latest Xbox Game Pass games. And thanks to Xbox Cloud Gaming, you can now stream games from the cloud to the Xbox One providing your internet connection is fast enough. There's also Amazon Alexa voice control should you wish to shout commands at your console. The PS4 menu takes a different path and arranges game and setting in a single line, with drop down option below. It's dead easy to use and there's are neat features like being able to tap the DualShock 4's Share button lets you record a clip, broadcast your gameplay or take a screenshot. There are plenty of option in the menu, but they are kept out of the way. Arguably the PS4 doesn't serve up as much information as the box One, but it certainly keeps things neater and cleaner. Plus the soothing background music is pleasant to the ear. Both consoles can broadcast gameplay directly to Twitch, though only PS4 can stream to YouTube. PS4 players can share their screenshots and videos to Facebook and Twitter, whereas Xbox owners are limited to the latter network."}
{"prompt":"iPhone vs. Android ->","completion":" iPhone vs. Android is the smartphone debate for the ages. The iPhone vs. Android comparison is a never-ending debate on which one is best. It will likely never have a real winner, but we're going to try and help you to find your personal pick all the same. The latest version of both operating systems — iOS 16 and Android 13 — are both excellent, but in slightly different ways. Many of their features overlap, but design-wise they look quite different, aside from the basic touchscreen-focused layout. Whichever of the best phones available today you buy, they'll be running one of these two OSes. Pitting iPhone vs. Android, we take a look at the respective strengths of each mobile platform, so you can pick the right one for you the next time you buy a smartphone. If you want to see the current flagships for Android and iOS, be sure to check out our Pixel 7 Pro vs. iPhone 14 Pro Max and Pixel 7 vs. iPhone 14 face-offs. And if you're convinced you want to leave your iPhone, read more about Google's new Switch To Android app that will help you move over.You're invested in Apple's ecosystem. iPhone vs Android: Why iPhone is better You're invested in Apple's ecosystem. This might seem like a shallow reason, but Apple obviously makes a wide breadth of tech products, and if you already own a Mac, iPad or Apple Watch, getting an iPhone makes a lot of sense. Apple has designed a multitude of continuity features that allow you to carry over work and data from one of its devices to another, and these features can certainly save you time. Take Handoff, for example, where calls on your iPhone and web pages in Safari can move seamlessly between iOS and macOS. Universal Clipboard makes text copied on one platform usable on the other. Another one of our favorites is Continuity Camera, which allows you to take pictures and scan documents using your iPhone's camera, and then view and edit them on your Mac. You can even complete purchases on your Mac by using biometric authentication features on your iPhone via Apple Pay. Only a handful of Android phone makers have hardware ecosystems that approach Apple's, and even for some that come close, like Samsung, you won't get the depth of integration possible between the iPhone and other Apple-built devices. Microsoft is helping Google close the gap somewhat with its new Your Phone app for Windows, which allows Android users to respond to texts and notifications on their PCs, though the experience is a little clunky and there is still work to be done. There are many other great examples of continuity across iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and macOS — and the iPhone is a critical component in that puzzle, especially now that iPhone apps can be seamlessly ported to macOS. Power users already immersed in Apple's ecosystem can stand to gain a lot by adding an iPhone to their repertoire. And that's to say nothing of friends and family members who prefer to use iMessage and FaceTime to keep in touch. The third-party apps are just better. This one is definitely down to personal preference, but as someone who has jumped back and forth between iOS and Android, I've been consistently blown away by the quality of apps built by iOS developers, and mostly disappointed in their Android counterparts. Don't get me wrong — there's great software and developers on Android, but they're harder to find, in my experience. One of our favorite Twitter apps, Tweetbot 5, is an iOS exclusive, for example; by contrast, one of the best third-party Twitter apps we've encountered on Android, Fenix 2, strongly pales in comparison. One of our staff members, Henry T. Casey, loves using Bear to compose blog posts on his Mac and iPhone, but we've struggled to find a note-taking app on Android as comprehensive and slick.You may even find that apps from established companies, ranging from banks to airlines, are a bit smoother and cleaner on iOS than Android, with better integration with the phone's core services, like Wallet. There's a bigger selection of accessories. Walk into any Best Buy or Target, and you'll find aisles of cases for every iPhone that Apple makes — something that certainly cannot be said for the Android contingent outside of flagship devices from the biggest companies. Once you get past the semi-healthy selection of products made for the latest Galaxy S device, you're out of luck. Don't bother expecting a choice of accessories for your new Pixel or Motorola handset at any brick-and-mortar retailer. Sure, you could go online and snag a $4 case off of Amazon, but then you're guaranteed to get what you pay for. The selection and availability of iPhone cases, screen protectors, car mounts and other goodies is simply far greater than you'll find for any other phone, and that's more important than most people realize. iPhone owners will never have the problem of not finding a case to their liking. There are enhanced privacy controls with app tracking notifications. One of the biggest recent iOS releases introduced app tracking notifications, allowing you to opt out of apps tracking you across your phone. This was a major win for privacy advocates and a huge blow to many third-party companies, like Facebook. Android simply doesn't have this feature and we doubt it ever will. Don't get stuck in the belief that iOS is inherently more private than Android, since Apple still collects a ton of data about you, but iOS still has a bit more resilience when it comes to third-parties. It's so satisfying to deny an app the ability to track you. There's no bloatware. No matter how you buy your iPhone, where you buy it from or what iPhone you buy, you won't see any bloatware preinstalled when you boot it up for the first time. That means it's clean from the very start, with no power- or data-siphoning apps you didn't ask for sabotaging things behind the scenes.That's a relief if you've ever seen the way a new Android phone arrives out of the box — particularly one that you've bought through a carrier. Even spending $1,800 on a Galaxy Z Fold 3 doesn't spare AT&T customers from the affront of seeing software like CNN and DirecTV Now cluttering their app drawers. And it can be even worse if you buy a budget handset that has been heavily subsidized by a discount carrier. Android buyers who purchase one of the best unlocked phones without a service agreement will have better luck avoiding bloatware. It also depends on the company. For example, unlocked Pixel phones aren't mired down by any third-party apps; on the other hand, it's not totally unheard of for some unlocked handsets to come with the odd unwelcome sponsored software (or ads). You get quicker software updates. Android phones get fewer updates than iPhones, and when they do, they happen less frequently and are often delayed with the exception of Google's Pixels. The number of updates an Android phone sees over the course of its lifetime depends largely on how expensive it is, what carrier you buy it from (or if it's even purchased from a carrier at all) and what the phone maker's software support policy is. That's a far cry from iPhones, which are supported with major software updates for many years, no matter what. Take the iPhone 6S, for example, which received iOS 15, even though it originally launched with iOS 9 back in 2015. For comparison, consider Samsung's Galaxy S6, which launched the same year and started with Android 5.0 Lollipop. Not only does it lack the latest Android software, but it stopped getting updates years ago. It only made it as far as 7.0 Nougat when Samsung pulled the plug on support — and when the S6 did get Nougat, it arrived in March 2017, eight months after Google unveiled the update. What's more, when a new iOS version is released, it is available to everyone on the same day, at the same time, and can be installed on all models that support it instantaneously. By contrast, Android releases are rolled out in waves to individual phones, not just by model. It has better retail support. Let's say something goes horribly wrong with your iPhone, and you need to get it serviced. Or perhaps you want a screen protector installed on it, and you'd rather have it handled by a professional, who will slap that film on with nary a bubble or speck of dust."}
{"prompt":"Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 ->","completion":" This Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 preview has us intrigued We're excited about the Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 showdown that'll come once Samsung launches its latest flagship series. Until then, we've heard enough rumors and leaks to get a general idea of what to expect from this face-off. Samsung and Google are both gunning to have the best Android phone and to earn your hard-earned cash, though the latter might have the upper hand in terms of pricing if Samsung stays true to its pattern from the last couple of years. The Galaxy S23 will kick off Android flagships for 2023, while the Pixel 7 will be one of the de facto Android handsets to consider until its successor arrives late in the year. Here's what to expect from the Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 face-off. If true, the Pixel 7 would undercut Samsung's latest since it clocks in at a mere $599. For that price, you get the versatile Tensor G2 processor, a powerful dual camera system, and a 90Hz 1080p display. It's one the best deals in smartphones. The Galaxy S23, at least based on some leaked renders, appears to have a slight design change in the works. From what we've seen so far, Samsung looks to intend to bring the whole Galaxy S23 lineup together in terms of design language. That means the Galaxy S22's Contour Cut is allegedly out, replaced by individual camera lenses like what you find on the Galaxy S22 Ultra. We're OK with this direction if it proves to be true. Meanwhile, the Pixel 7 refined the design direction that Google introduced with the Pixel 6 in 2021. The distinctive camera bar remains, spanning the width of the phone. It's metal this time around, adding a pop of sophistication. We're sad to see the Pixel 6's three tone design go, which we thought added some personality to the Pixel lineup. Still, we love the Pixel 7's overall look. There's no other smartphone like it. As for displays, we expect the Galaxy S23 to remain at 6.1 inches with a FHD+ resolution. The Galaxy S22 could ramp up its refresh rate to 120Hz, but clock down to just 48MHz. Other competing phones go down to 10Hz, or even 1Hz (like the OnePlus 10 Pro or Galaxy S22 Ultra). The Galaxy S22 had a super bright display, measuring 1,152 nits in our testing. You should anticipate the Galaxy S23 to at least match that, if not exceed it. The Pixel 7 sports a great 6.3-inch OLED display with a FHD+ resolution and 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. While lacking the punchy colors and insane brightness of the Galaxy S22, it is more than visible in daylight with a max brightness of 926 nits in our testing. We won't be surprised if the Galaxy S23's display mops the floor with the Pixel 7, but that's because Samsung has the best panels in the Android market. The true victor in this showdown will earn its victory in the camera department. Google holds the title for the best Android camera phones. Despite Samsung making some major progress in recent years, the Galaxy S22 still struggles to keep up with the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro. The Galaxy S23 Ultra might overtake Google, though. Samsung will likely keep the triple camera setup that's it had for a while now. The rumors say we'll see a 12MP main sensor along with a 12MP ultrawide shooter and a 10MP telephoto lens (another rumor says 11MP). As for zoom, the Galaxy S22 had a 3x optical capacity, so it's likely the Galaxy S23 will keep that. The latest rumors also say the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S23 will get a new 12MP front-facing camera, which would be an upgrade over the previous 10MP sensors. The Pixel 7 uses its 50MP main and 12MP ultrawide sensors to incredible effect. This phone takes amazing pictures in most scenarios, giving the iPhone 14 a major run for its money. Google reserved the telephoto lens for the Pixel 7 Pro, but the Pixel 7 enjoys all of the other computational photography tricks of its bigger brother. Those things include features like Magic Eraser, which can intelligently remove objects and people from your pictures; Photo Unblur which can repair a lot of blurry photos; and Active Stabilization, which acts as video stabilization on steroids. The Pixel 7 has set a high bar for the Galaxy S23 to clear. We're excited to see if Samsung can do it. When it comes to performance, we expect the Galaxy S23 to come equipped with more horsepower than the Pixel 7. That's because the Pixel's Tensor G2 chipset falls behind the Galaxy S22 and its Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 in synthetic benchmarks. With the Galaxy S23 all but guaranteed to get the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, Google is likely to fall further behind in performance. For instance, in Geekbench 5, the Pixel 7 turned in 1,054 \/ 3,021 in single-core and multicore, respectively. The Galaxy S22 scored 1,204 and 3,248. Not a huge gap, but it's likely to widen with the new Qualcomm chip. But raw numbers don't tell the whole story, since the Pixel 7's smarts far exceed what the Galaxy S22 can do. It's possible that Samsung will catch up with the Galaxy S23, but we're skeptical. The Pixel 7 did not wow us with its battery life. In our custom test, where we task a phone to endlessly reload web pages over a cellular connection, it returned a result of 7 hours and 17 minutes in its adaptive refresh rate mode. Not that the Galaxy S22 was much better at 7 hours and 51 minutes. We like to see at least ten hours in this test, so Samsung has a lot of room for improvement with the Galaxy S23. Rumors suggest the battery might get a boost to 3,885 mAh for the regular Galaxy S23 and 4,700 mAh for the Galaxy S23 Plus. If true, that ought to improve longevity. Another large differentiator between the Galaxy S23 and Pixel 7 will be software. Samsung's One UI is a feature-packed rendition of Android and the phone maker has vastly improved its software design and update schedule in recent years. One UI 5, based on Android 13, is solid, which is what the Galaxy S23 will run out of the box. The Pixel 7 runs Google's vision of Android 13, complete with the Material You theming engine. It's relatively stripped back compared to One UI, but don't let that fool you. Google has packed in a lot of useful things like the whole Call Suite (including the ever-useful Call Screen, which screens your calls), the photography stuff we mentioned earlier, and the Now Playing music identifier. The Pixel 7 also enjoys day one access to the latest updates and security patches from Google. There are also the quarterly Feature Drops, where Google introduces smaller feature sets outside of the annual Android release schedule. We won't say one is better than the other since it's a personal preference, but where Samsung currently leads Google comes down to how many updates it promises. It has committed to four years of platform updates and five years of security patches, which is the best you can get on an Android phone. That means the Galaxy S23 will receive Android 17 and security patches into 2028. Google, meanwhile, also promises five years of security updates, but only three years of Android upgrades. So Samsung has the advantage right out of the gate. The Galaxy S23 vs. Pixel 7 face-off will be an interesting one. We should only have a couple more months to wait to see what Samsung has built, then we can pit the Galaxy S23 against Google's $599 flagship.The victory will ultimately depend on how each phone does in our camera and battery life tests. Google has quite a lead heading into this showdown, but Samsung could have a few tricks up its sleeve. For now, we will have to rely on rumors and leaks to get a better idea about the Galaxy S23, so be sure to check our Galaxy S23 hub for all of the latest news. And if you want to learn everything about Google's phone, head over to our Pixel 7 review."}
